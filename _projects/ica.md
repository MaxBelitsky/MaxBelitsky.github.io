# overview:
#   what: >
#     I partnered with IBM Consulting leadership to launch an AI-powered delivery platform that puts
#     reusable assets, accelerators, and playbooks in the hands of every engagement team.
#   why: >
#     Consultants lose time reinventing the wheel. By packaging our collective expertise with
#     generative AI assist, I helped teams ship client-ready work faster and with more consistency.
# details:
#   contribution: >
#     I co-led discovery with product, design, and delivery leads; translated those insights into
#     AI-assisted workflows; and built the retrieval pipelines that surface the right assets inside
#     consultantsâ€™ day-to-day tools.
#   architecture: >
#     I orchestrated a retrieval-augmented generation stack that unifies structured delivery data,
#     IBM watsonx models, and guardrail services, exposing them through modular APIs and workspace
#     components.
#   tools:
#     - IBM watsonx
#     - Retrieval-Augmented Generation
#     - FastAPI
#     - Kubernetes
#     - ElasticSearch
#   results: >
#     I delivered internal pilots that let engagement teams assemble proposals and delivery assets in
#     minutes, yielding double-digit time savings in discovery and proposal prep and earning executive
#     sponsorship for the global rollout.
