# overview:
#   what: >
#     I co-created Philyra with Symrise as an AI copilots for master perfumers—marrying generative
#     modeling with decades of fragrance expertise to explore new scent directions on demand.
#   why: >
#     Crafting a fragrance is bounded by safety regulations, cost, and creative intent. By keeping
#     perfumers in the loop and letting AI surface novel yet compliant ideas, I helped teams move from
#     brief to winning concept faster.
# details:
#   contribution: >
#     I modelled historic fragrance briefs, encoded IFRA regulations, and designed the co-creation
#     workflow that lets perfumers steer the AI toward olfactive territories that still feel on-brand.
#   architecture: >
#     I trained sequence-based generative models on proprietary ingredient datasets, layered in cost
#     and compliance scoring, and exposed the system through an interactive studio that iterates on AI
#     suggestions alongside perfumer feedback.
#   tools:
#     - Generative Modeling
#     - TensorFlow
#     - Python
#     - Docker
#     - IBM Cloud
#   results: >
#     Symrise perfumers used Philyra to craft award-winning fragrances for brands like O Boticário,
#     and the collaboration became a flagship example of human–AI creativity highlighted by the press.
