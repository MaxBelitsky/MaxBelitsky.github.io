  abstract={We introduce KV Cache Steering, a novel approach to enhance reasoning capabilities in small language models by manipulating their key-value cache representations. Our method demonstrates significant improvements in logical reasoning tasks while maintaining computational efficiency. Through extensive experiments on various benchmarks, we show that our approach can induce reasoning behaviors typically observed only in much larger models. The technique opens new avenues for deploying capable language models in resource-constrained environments.},

  abstract={This paper presents a novel approach to examining team interaction patterns through dynamic complexity measures and network visualizations. We analyze real-time team communication data to identify key interaction patterns that correlate with team performance. Our methodology combines network analysis techniques with complexity measures to provide insights into effective team dynamics. The results demonstrate significant correlations between specific interaction patterns and successful team outcomes.},
